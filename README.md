# hexagons
Dynamic visualizations using hexagons as the basic unit.

## Overview
This project is the intersection of my interest in learning SDL2 and modern
OpenGL with my interest in creating dynamic visualizations. It is a work in
progress (currently only drawing one hexagon to the screen).

## Implemented Visualizations
+ Conway's Game of Life.

## Planned Visualizations
+ Conway's Game of Life.
+ Music visualizer.
+ Search algorithm visualizer.
  + DFS
  + BFS
  + MS-BFS
  + Obstacles (unpassible hexagons)
  + Mazes (unpassible hexagon edges)
  + A\*
